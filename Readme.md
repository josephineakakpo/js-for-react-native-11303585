task 1:The ⁠ processArray ⁠ function is that takes an array of numbers as an argument. It then performs specific operations on each number in the array to create a modified array.

In the ⁠ processArray ⁠ function, each even number in the input array is squared, which means it is multiplied by itself. This operation is achieved by multiplying the even number by itself using the ⁠ * ⁠ operator. On the other hand, each odd number is tripled, which means it is multiplied by 3. This operation is achieved by multiplying the odd number by 3.

After processing each number in the input array, the ⁠ processArray ⁠ function returns a new array that contains the modified numbers. This new array will have the same length as the input array, with each even number squared and each odd number tripled.




task 2:The ⁠ formatArrayStrings ⁠ function in the ⁠ arrayManipulation.js ⁠ file takes two arrays as arguments: an array of strings and an array of numbers processed by the ⁠ processArray ⁠ function. 

It modifies each string in the string array based on its corresponding number. If the number is even, the entire string is capitalized. If the number is odd, the string is converted to lowercase.



task 3:The `userInfo.js` file has a function called `createUserProfile` that takes an array of names and an array of modified names as arguments. It returns an array of objects containing the original names, modified names, and IDs.
